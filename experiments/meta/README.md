TODOs
- [x] Defined STLC in [`STLC.fst`](./STLC.fst)
- [x] Defined Operational Semantics using Progress and Preservation ([`eval`](./STLC.fst))
    - [ ] Prove termination of `eval`. One can build on top of the [proof that normalization halts](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/Norm.html) from Software Foundations.
- [x] Define elaboration of STLC expressions into F* ([`elab_exp`](./STLC.fst))
- [x] Define a relation between F* values and STLC expressions ([`≍`](./CriteriaStatic.STLC.fst))
- [x] Prove that relation `≍` implies compiler correctness of whole programs ([`rel_implies_cc`](./CriteriaStatic.STLC.fst)).
- [ ] Prove that relation `≍` implies RHC 
    - [ ] Prove an intermediary lemma that STLC expression is in rel `≍` with its elaboration ([`elab_rel`](./CriteriaStatic.STLC.fst)). 
        - [ ] Prove an intermediary lemma that the elaboration of an STLC expression is equal to the elaboration of the evaluated expression ([`elab_eq_elab_eval`](./STLC.fst)).
- [ ] Prove that compilation returns an STLC expression in rel `≍` with the initial F* value
