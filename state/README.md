# SecRef★: Securely Sharing Mutable References Between Verified and Unverified Code in F★

This directory contains the artifact for SecRef★. The layout is as
follows:
- MST.Repr: Free monad representation
- MST.Tot: MST Effect definition
- Examples.*: Various examples
- misc/: dune configuration files for examples

- fstar-patches/: a set of patches needed for F*, to enable primitive
  extraction of reifiable effects (and fix two bugs).

- extraction/: The extraction plugin for SecRef★. Run `make` inside
  here to build it. It will also be built automatically by the `build-%`
  rule, but *not* rebuilt, so do it manually if you've changed anything
  here or if F* has changed.

You need F* version 2025.02.17 **with the patches** to run this artifact.
A way to get set up is:

  git clone https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar
  cd FStar
  git checkout v2025.02.17
  git am /path/to/artifact/fstar-patches/*.patch
  opam install --deps-only .
  make -j$(nproc) ADMIT=1

After a while, a built F* should be avaiable under in `FStar/bin/fstar.exe`. Add
this directory to your PATH and then run the Makefile here.

You also need Z3 version 4.13.3 in your PATH, named z3-4.13.3 so F* can find it.
The script in `FStar/.scripts/get_fstar_z3.sh` can be used to automatically set it up

  ./FStar/.scripts/get_fstar_z3.sh ~/bin

Should install z3-4.13.3 into your ~/bin (and Z3 4.8.5, though we do not use it).

## Verifying

After setting up F*, running `make` in this repository should verify
all the F* files in it, including our formalization and examples. You
can also inspect the files interactively in VS Code by installing the
fstar-vscode-assistant extension.

Note: the autograder example has parts of them admitted due to difficulties working with F* and fleshing out the proofs. We are confident we can soon fully verify everything. Do note, the framework itself is admit-free. All the other examples verify admit-free, are compiled using SecRef★, extract and can be run in OCaml.

## Running the examples

The examples can be built by using the extraction plugin to extract them
into native OCaml, and then building them with dune. This is process
is a bit complicated so there is a rule in the Makefile to automate it.
Simply run `make build-Examples.Intro` to verify, extract, build, and run
`Examples.Intro.fst`. Other files can be run by replacing `Examples.Intro` for something else.

## Mapping from sections to files:

- Section 1: `Examples.Intro.fst`
- Section 2: `Examples.Autograder.fst`, `Examples.PRNG.fst`
- Section 3: `MST.Repr.fst`, `MST.Soundness.fst`
- Section 4: `SharedRefs.fsti` (`LR` under the name `SST`), `ShareableType.fst` (`full_ground_typ` under the name `shareable_typ`)
- Section 5: `HigherOrderContracts.fst`
- Section 6: `Compiler.fst`
- Section 7: `CooperativeMultiThreadingWithIndexT.fst`
