# Partial Dijkstra monads

Should work fine with Coq 8.14.

## TODO

- Next step is the guarded construction and then use it for stuff like ND and
maybe IO?
- Laws
- What are the good expectations of a PDM?
- Make the DM4Free construction in general by applying the transformer to G
- Is it equivalent from having a lift from PURE?
