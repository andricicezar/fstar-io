## List of Claims

The artifact contains:
* a formalization of the contributions from the paper;
* the mechanized proofs of soundness and of RrHP;
* the verified examples: autograder and PRGN;
* the case study: cooperative multi-threading scheduler
* other examples.

We list where the definitions and theorems of the paper are.

## Download and Installation

The directory layout is as follows:
- misc/: dune configuration files for examples

- fstar-patches/: a set of patches needed for F*, to enable primitive
  extraction of reifiable effects (and fix two bugs).

- extraction/: The extraction plugin for SecRefâ˜…. Run `make` inside
  here to build it. It will also be built automatically by the `build-%`
  rule, but *not* rebuilt, so do it manually if you've changed anything
  here or if F* has changed.

You need F* version 2025.02.17 **with the patches** to run this artifact.
A way to get set up is:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar
cd FStar
git checkout v2025.02.17
git am /path/to/artifact/fstar-patches/*.patch
opam install --deps-only .
make -j$(nproc) ADMIT=1
```

After a while, a built F* should be avaiable under in `FStar/bin/fstar.exe`. Add
this directory to your PATH and then run the Makefile here.

You also need Z3 version 4.13.3 in your PATH, named z3-4.13.3 so F* can find it.
The script in `FStar/.scripts/get_fstar_z3.sh` can be used to automatically set it up

```
./FStar/.scripts/get_fstar_z3.sh ~/bin
```

Should install z3-4.13.3 into your ~/bin (and Z3 4.8.5, though we do not use it).
You can clone the [sources of F\*](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar),
at the tag v2023.09.03 (commit hash `7363057dc7dceb13e39d5afb2b1dd46161314f25`)
and run `opam install .` in the root.
That will take care of compiling and installing F\* into OPAM.

Once installed, if `fstar.exe` is in your $PATH, then running `make`
will verify all modules in this directory. Otherwise, edit the `FSTAR`
variable in the Makefile to point to your F\* binary. You can use `-j`
to run several jobs in parallel.

See more details about [how to install F\* here](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

## Evaluation Instructions

### Verify SecRef\*

**Expected time:** around 4 minutes

**Script for this step:**

After setting up F*, running `make` in this repository should verify
all the F* files in it, including our formalization and examples. You
can also inspect the files interactively in VS Code by installing the
fstar-vscode-assistant extension.

```bash
~/secrefstar$ make verify
```

**Expected outbout** should be a long list of files verified by F\*. A
  few blue warnings appear which can be ignored.

### Running the examples

The examples can be built by using the extraction plugin to extract them
into native OCaml, and then building them with dune. This is process
is a bit complicated so there is a rule in the Makefile to automate it.
Simply run `make build-Examples.Intro` to verify, extract, build, and run
`Examples.Intro.fst`. Other files can be run by replacing `Examples.Intro` for something else.

## Reusability

One can use this artifact in many ways:
* to verify and compile a program by taking advantage of SMT automation;
